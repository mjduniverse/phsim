# phsim
PhSim is a library built on top of Matter.js. PhSim allows one to easily create a physics simulation without much hassle.
PhSim could be used to create games as well.

# Some of the features:

<ul>
<li>Constraints</li>
<li>Circular Constraints</li>
<li>Various forms of motion, such as rotation, velocity, position change, accelration, force and more</li>
<li>Sprites</li>
<li>Newtonian Gravitational Fields</li>
<li>Gradients</li>
<li>Audio</li>
<li>Objects that can be dragged by the mouse</li>
<li>The ablity to easily create games by treating composite simulations as games and the individual simulations as levels.</li>
</ul>
